Om
=========================

This kurs is about technical web design. When I read the catalogues and get totally lost, where is view folder, header.php and footer.php. Instead there are lots of .md files and anax folder and config folder with lots of
PHP files. What is all this? Then I try to google about framework and markdown and start to watch video from Mikael.
Ok, the aim is not to understand the whole framework but just to decorate the web with CSS in kmom01
and get familiar to anax flat framework for future study.
